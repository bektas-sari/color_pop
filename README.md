# Color Pop (Flutter APP)

A fun and engaging Flutter-based mobile game designed for children aged 4-6. Players must pop colorful balloons before they reach the top of the screen, improving reaction speed, attention, and hand-eye coordination.

## Features

* **Modern UI & Smooth Animations**: Gradient background, soft cloud effects, and glassmorphism-style HUD.
* **Dynamic Difficulty**: Balloon speed increases over time to keep the game challenging.
* **Instant Game Over**: The game ends immediately if a balloon reaches the top.
* **HUD at Bottom**: Score, level, lives, and control buttons are positioned at the bottom for better ergonomics.
* **No Sound Effects**: Ideal for quiet environments (optional sound can be added later).
* **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
* **Exit & Restart Options**: Easily accessible at game over.
